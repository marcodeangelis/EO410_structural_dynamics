# Multi-degree-of-freedom systems

A multi-degree-of-freedom (MDF) system is composed of masses interconnected via elastic springs. When a MDF system is subject to a dynamic excitation it oscillates. 

In the animation, we show the response in time of a three-degree-of-freedom system subject to an impact excitation exerted on the first mass.
